# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
  const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users';
  const users = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json()).catch((err) => []);
  console.log(users)
  return users;
}
getUsers()
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer
This code would work due to the fact that when using async/await the function will wait until the fetch and JSON to be completed before moving on with the code, and if not it will catch the error and return an empty array.
